        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <ul><h3>Album Cover Art Connection:</h3>
            <li>The iconic cover art for The Strokes' debut album, "Is This It," created quite a buzz. The original cover featured a photograph of a woman's naked behind and hip, taken by Colin Lane. However, due to concerns about the image being too explicit, the cover was altered for the U.S. release. The U.S. version showcased subatomic particle trails instead. The original cover was used for the international release and later for the 2019 reissue of the album.</li>
            <h3>Nick Valensi's Father is a Renowned Photographer:</h3>
            <li> Nick Valensi, the guitarist for The Strokes, is the son of American photographer and film director Albert Valensi. His father is known for capturing iconic images of various influential figures, including Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan, and Salvador Dal√≠. This artistic background likely contributed to Nick's appreciation for aesthetics and visual elements, which can be seen in The Strokes' overall image and album artwork.</li>
            <h3>First Preformance at the Spiral:</h3>
            <li> The Strokes' first-ever public performance took place at the Spiral, a venue in Manhattan, in 1999. The band's early gigs in New York City helped them build a local fanbase and gain attention from record labels.
